## Instructions

User journey diagrams visualize the experience of a user as they interact with a system or service, showing different stages and touchpoints.

### Blueprint Styling

Journey diagrams use built-in score-based coloring. Structure sections to match Blueprint layers (Discovery = Blue, Purchase = Teal, Post-Purchase = Green).

### Syntax

- Use `journey` keyword
- Title: `title Title Text` (optional)
- Sections: `section Section Name` (groups steps into stages)
- Steps: `Step Name: Score: Actor1, Actor2`
- Score: Number between 1 and 5 (inclusive) - represents satisfaction level
- Actors: Comma-separated list of actors who perform the step
